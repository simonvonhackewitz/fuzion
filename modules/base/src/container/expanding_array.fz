# expanding_array -- an array with a length and a (possible larger) capacity
#
# An expanding array is a persitent data structure that has cumulitive O(1)
# performance of adding single elements towards the end.
#
# WARNING: Due to the high worst-case time for addition, this structure should
# not be used in situations when adding a single element repeatedly to the same
# instance of `expanding_array` is performance critical.  If the resulting
# `expanding_array`'s length `l` is a power of 2, this will trigger the worst-case
# addition time resulting in O(m*l) for adding an element m times.
#
# This constructor is for internal use only, to create instance of
# expanding_array, use NYI
